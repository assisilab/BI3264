# Welcome to Mathematical and Computational Biology (BI3264)

The goal of this course is to analyze and simulate mathematical and computational models of biological systems. Classical examples will be drawn from the literature that best illustrate the seamless integration of mathematics and biology, such as modeling in neuroscience (the classification of spiking activity based on different bifurcation scenarios), enzyme kinetics (slow-fast analysis and the Michaelis-Menten equations), pattern formation in development and others.

The target audience is two-fold:
1.	Biology students will get introduced to some of the best examples of mathematical reasoning in biology. This is an excellent first step to thinking about modeling in your own work.
2.	Students from other disciplines can view the course as an “Introduction to Mathematical Modeling” with examples drawn from Biology. They will learn techniques that have been found useful in applied mathematics, and at the same time, they will get a feel for important and interesting problems arising in Biology (and Chemistry).

Many of the models will also be simulated on a computer. In the process, students will be introduced to programming in Python, and numerical techniques to solve ordinary and partial differential equations.
